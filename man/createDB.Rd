\title{Create a relational data base file.}
\usage{
createDB(dfList, pkList, fkList = NULL, metaData = NULL, filePath)
}
\arguments{
\item{dfList}{Named list of data frames. The order of the data.frames determines the merge order.}

\item{pkList}{Named list of the primary keys corresponding to the data.frames.}

\item{fkList}{Named list of a list per data.frame, including referenced data frame (\code{fkList$References}) and the corresponding keys \code{fkList$Keys}). Default is \code{NULL}, which should be used if only a single data frame is supplied. For multiple data.frames, \code{fkList$References} and \code{fkList$Keys} should be \code{NULL} for the first data.frame.}

\item{metaData}{[optional] Data.frame including meta data information about the other data.frames.}

\item{filePath}{Path to the db file to write (including name); has to end on \code{.db}.}
}
\value{
Creates a data base in the given path, returns NULL.
}
\description{
Creates a relational data base from a list of data.frames (\code{dfList}). The list structure including the naming of \code{dfList}, \code{pkList} and \code{fkList} needs to be exactly the same. Keys (\code{pkList} and \code{fkList$Keys}) can either be character vectors with a single variable name or multiple variable names. Primary keys (\code{pkList}) have to be unique within a single data.frame. Foreign Keys (\code{fkList}) have to consist of a list with the referenced data frame (\code{fkList$References}) and the referencing keys (\code{fkList$Keys}). If a single data frame is to be converted to a data base, \code{pkList} can be dropped. Otherwise, both elements of \code{fkList} need to be set to \code{NULL}.
}
\details{
Primary keys guarantee uniqueness of cases within a single data.frame, and are single variables or combinations of variables. Foreign keys are used to merge data.frames. The foreign key for the first data set always has to be set to \code{list(References = NULL, Keys = NULL)}. The order in which the data.frames are supplied determines the merge order. Currently, left joins are performed when merging data.frames. However, data.frames are stored separately in the relational data base and are only merged if pulled from the data base. \\
Conventions for naming variables (columns) follow naming conventions of SQLite3. '.' and \code{\link{sqlite_keywords}} are prohibited. Two additional tables within the SQLite3 data base are created: \code{Meta_Information}, which contains a single character with the merge order that is used by \code{\link{dbPull}} and \code{Meta_Data}, which contains the meta data.frame supplied to the argument \code{metaData}.

\examples{
# Set up data frames
df1 <- data.frame(v1 = 1, ID2 = 1)
df2 <- data.frame(ID2 = 1:1, v2 = 1:2)
dfList <- list(df1 = df1, df2 = df2)

# Specify primary keys
pkList <- list(df1 = "v1", df2 = c("ID2", "v2"))
# Specify foreign keys
fkList <- list(df1 = list(References = NULL, Keys = NULL),
               df2 = list(References = "df1", Keys = "ID2"))

# Create in memory data base
createDB(dfList = dfList, pkList = pkList, fkList = fkList, metaData = NULL, filePath = ":memory:")
